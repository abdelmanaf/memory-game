# Memory-Game

This game is base on matching colors. In this game, you will have the option to chose the card from the board.
If the card color match your second choice, them the two cards will stay open until the game finish. And so on.
In the case the cards don't match,they flip over; then you get another chance to guess others cards.

Chose carefully!
